# Todo List

- Node relations should add a tag `_managed_by_node` or something similar, so that only these are removed and
  recreated after an update.  
  Otherwise this would potentially remove independent relations and relations provided by 3rd party tools.
- Index-synchronisation shouldn't be "soft".
- Documentation.
- UnitTests.
- Psalm.
- [PHP Code Coverage](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/php-code-coverage).
- [PHPStan](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan).
- [PHP mutation testing](https://infection.github.io/).
- Publish on Packagist :D
